# pluginDownloader
Just my little program to download stuff. Was orriginally written with the intent of download spigot and sponge plugins from jenkins and github. hopefully soon to include downloads from spigotmc but thats not as of yet

It requires the requests library and thats about it

the config is formatted in json. 
The type can be either "none" or "github" that just determines what site it is downloading from and how it downloads stuff
